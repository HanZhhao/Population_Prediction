# Population_Prediction

Currently, China is facing a social stage of low fertility rate and accelerated population aging. Previous research has only focused on macro policy issues, ignoring the impact of population fertility willingness on fertility rates and the impact of education, healthcare, and other policies on fertility willingness. In this article, we first establish a differential equation for the population's evolution over time and introduce a migration matrix to simulate the population flow among urban, suburban, and rural areas to predict the population changes in each region over the next 50 years and determine the ideal optimal aging rate. Then, we establish a fertility model that objectively reflects the probability distribution of fertility age under various policies and birth order. Next, we analyze the impact of different factors on fertility willingness and explore how related infrastructure affects corresponding factors, providing the government with construction strategies in the short and long term. Finally, we determine the policy and infrastructure construction model that can minimize the aging rate.
